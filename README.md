TransLoc_hack
=============

Various scripts to process and store TransLoc API data.

The Python scripts were developed using Python 3.4 and store data in a PostreSQL 9.3 database. The SQL files contain code to create the tables into which the Python scripts deposit data. To adapt them for your own use, you'll need to create the PostreSQL database, acquire a Mashape API key from http://mashape.com, and change the database name and username constants. Mroe to come.
